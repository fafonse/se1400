            <h2>Who's the Audience?</h2>
            &nbsp;I think that when it comes to my website, most of my audience
            will be from the USA.
            I wont specifically try to appeal to Americans, but as an American
            myself, my writing style
            will likely appeal to those like me. I don't think this website will
            appeal to any specific gender,
            but I think young people willl like it more. I'm young myself, so I
            can write youthfully I guess.

            <br>
            Outside of that though, I think this website will just attracts
            artists in general.
            I want to provide a blog that's at least interesting to artists if
            not anything else.
