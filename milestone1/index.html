            <h2>Website Summary</h2>
            <h4>What content will this site contain?</h4>
            <p>&nbsp;This website will contain various written articles/blogs
                about art, from creation to appreciation.</p>
            <h4>Where will this site get this content?</h4>
            <p>&nbsp;All written content is created by me (Fabrizio). Art will
                be sourced from the public domain as well as my own work. AI
                generated content is not allowed, out of concern for quality and
                ethics.</p>
            <h4>Why should users care?</h4>
            <p>&nbsp;This site aims to provide a casual perspective. Personally
                I find a lot of articles online that may describe techniques,
                but don't teach them in a way that can be applied outside of
                their medium.
                However, when looking for more practical techniques online, its
                easy to stumble upon
                "hacks", which may teach a technique but don't explain the why
                the technique works.
                I hope to bridge the gap between the two, providing
                comprehensive information with practical applications.
            </p>
            <h4>Why should a site be built for this?</h4>
            <p>&nbsp;As much as I could publish these articles on blogging sites
                like Medium and Blogspot, those websites have their own issues.
                Many blogging services have restricted designs and look outdated
                in the modern web, and article hosting like Medium
                tends to drown out anything that isn't self-help or productivity
                focused. By using my own website, I get both
                the freedom of design and a stage to myself.
            </p>
            <h4>What do you want users to do here?</h4>
            <p>
                &nbsp;Honestly, just reading my articles is enough. I do plan
                however on adding interactivity, maybe through
                a comment section, and definitely with a site guestbook. For
                those wanting to go the extra mile, sharing and referencing my
                articles with others
                would be great for increasing my audience.
            </p>
            <h4>Whats the goal of this site?</h4>
            <p>
                &nbsp;To help others with their art. When I was younger I
                remember pouring over articles looking to improve my art, but I
                mostly found junk articles
                that rarely offered anything besides a cursory review of a
                subject.
                Hopefully this website can provide a more personal touch.
