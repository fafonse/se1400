            <p>Do you ever struggle to get clean lines first try? Like, pencil on paper, you can't get your lines to be
                steady enough for a final draft? You might think that if it's hard to draw a long line, its better to
                split it into multiple tiny ones.</p>
            <b>DONT DO THAT!!</b>
            <br>
            <i>Why not??</i>
            <br>
            <p>You might be asking, not understanding the harm of the forsaken technique. Today I'll teach you the ways
                of the line, and how you can move past the horrors of chicken scratching.</p>
            <h2>What is Chicken Scratching?</h2>
            <p>Chicken scratching is the intentional (sorta) feathering of lines. Specifically, it's done as a handicap
                to a lack of skill from the artist. If you're ever wondering if it's chicken scratching or style, just
                ask yourself if you could do the line in a single pass without feathering it. If you can't, then it's
                chicken scratching.</p>
            <img src="chicken-scratch-comparison" alt="Chicken scratching vs. confident lines">
            <p>It's important to differentiate chicken scratching from style. A lot of artists will claim chicken
                scratching as part of their style, even if it's born from novice art skills. You got to know the rules
                before you can break them, and style is all about breaking the rules. If you have to rely on chicken
                scratching to produce the lines you want, then it isn't a stylistic <i>choice</i>, but rather a crutch.
            </p>
            <h2>Why Stop?</h2>
            <p>Some people may argue that chicken scratching isn't all that bad. </p>
            <br>
            <p>They're wrong.</p>
            <br>
            <p>First off, chicken scratching in general looks worse compared to normal lines. You lose a lot of control
                over the line weight and direction, as the inherent fuzziness hides the line intent. Sharp curves look
                smoother, and line weight must be less subtle to compensate. If you're feathering a line with a 1px
                brush, that line has to be at least 3 or 4 pixels wide with the added feathering. Even if you "trim" off
                the excess, you lose a consistent line weight, as you can't precisely erase the same amount on both
                sides of the line.</p>
            <img src="thick-chicken.jpg" alt="trimmed-chicken.jpg">
            <p>However, the bigger issue is that chicken scratching prevents further artistic development. While
                continual growth isn't a goal for everyone, chicken scratching is a relatively early hurdle in artistic
                development. Even if only used for sketching, chicken scratching obscures details and makes it harder
                for the artist to later retrace a polished final line art. Chicken scratching prevents the artist from
                learning line confidence, which is essential to good sketches and line art. Line confidence is how you
                can get clean lines, steady line weights, and real dynamism in the drawing.</p>

            <h2>Beyond the Scratch</h2>
            <p>Well, how do you fix chicken scratching?</p>
            <p>Line confidence isn't an easy skill to pick up overnight, and redrawing lines over and over again can
                really slow down drawing speed in the beginning. It can also be scary losing what many feel is part of
                their personal style.</p>
            <p>If you're still hung up on chick scratching as part of your personal style, try figuring out what it adds
                to your drawings. What role does chicken scratching fill? In good art, everything is intentional (even
                the random stuff). So you got to ask yourself, what is chicken scratching doing for you?</p>
            <p>If you want that increased line "energy", good line confidence can help you add direction to the energy,
                supporting the line with more direction and intention.
                Want that dynamic line weight? Learn to control your pen pressure and stability, and you can draw
                gorgeous thick lines that are amazingly smooth.
                Love that sketchy quality? Draw overlapping lines instead, which can slowly build up a shape and add
                thickness without any fuzziness.</p>
            <img src="line-confidence.jpg" alt="Examples of line confidence being better than chicken scratching">
            <p>When it comes to good exercises for practicing your line art, I'd say one of the most underrated and
                easiest to do is to simply draw with pen. Pencil gives you tons of leeway with mistakes, but with line
                art you really want to get it right within a couple strokes. Ink forces you to make each mark with
                deliberation, forcing you to know what you want to draw before you put ink down. It's going to look
                rough for a bit, but after a while, you can really visualize what you want without construction. Of
                course, use reference as much as you'd like, but it's more important that you gain line confidence than
                be "correct".</p>
            <p>Here are some examples from my own art:</p>
            <img src="my-examples.jpg" alt="Examples of my line confidence practice">
            <p>After a while, I've been able to draw in limited programs like MSpaint, as I can do everything without
                needing tons of construction or sketching. Line confidence is more than just clean strokes, it's also
                being able to have your art piece figured out before you even begin.</p>
